####     You can use our Azure Pipelines configuration for macOS buils of Conan packages
####
####     If you want to continue to use Travis, change your import either to
####
####     import: bincrafters/templates:.ci/travis-macos-installer.yml@12f4883f65fcbc521d7425636083ce9bba4be5cd
####
####     or directly copy the configure scripts into your own.
####
####     We are going to delete this config file eventually. And your script will stop working.
